;;│ UNICODE characters are available to draw nice boxes and lines.
;;│ They come in 4 flavours: thin, thick, double, and quadrant-blocks.
;;│ Uniline makes it easy to draw and combine all 4 flavours.
;;│ Use the arrows on the keyboard to move around leaving a line behind.
;;╰──────────────────────────╮
;;╭─Minor mode───────────────╯
;;│ Uniline is a minor mode.  Enter it with:
;;│   M-x uniline-mode
;;│ Leave it with:
;;│   C-c C-c
;;╰──────────────────────────╮
;;╭─Fonts────────────────────╯
;;│ A font able to displays the needed UNICODE characters have to
;;│ be used.  It works well with the following families:
;;│ - DejaVu Sans Mono
;;│ - Unifont
;;│ - Hack
;;│ - JetBrains Mono
;;│ - Cascadia Mono
;;│ - Agave
;;│ - JuliaMono
;;│ - FreeMono

;;│ - Aporetic Sans Mono, Aporetic Serif Mono
;;│ - Source Code Pro
;;╰──────────────────────────╮
;;╭─UTF-8────────────────────╯
;;│ Also, the encoding of the file must support UNICODE.
;;│ One way to do that, is to add a line like this one
;;│ at the top of your file:

;;╭─Hydra or Transient───────╯
;;│ Uniline comes with two flavours of user interfaces:
;;│ Hydra and Transient.
;;│ Both versions are compiled when installing the package.

;;│ Then one or the other packages must be loaded (not both)
;;│ for example with:
;;│   (require 'uniline-hydra)
;;│ or
;;│   (use-package uniline-hydra
;;│     :bind ("C-<insert>" . uniline-mode))

;;│ This file, uniline-core.el, is the largest one, the one

;;;│Coding decisions│
;;;╰────────────────╯

;; Why so much use of (defmacro)?
;; Because we handle 4 directions: north, east, south, west.
;; We end up writing slightly the same algorithms 4 times.
;; It is easier to centralise the algorithms in a set
;; of (defmacro) to write them just once.

;; Isn't (defun) enough and more readable than (defmacro)?
;; Yes, absolutely!
;; We can centralize algorithms in a set of (defun).
;; However a (defun) generically handling all four directions
;; misses nice code-folding.
;; For instance somewhere we have:
;;   (ash 3 (* 2 dir))
;; If the compiler sees `dir' as `uniline-direction-dw↓',
;; for example, then it can fold this expression to just 48,
;; which is nice©

;; We call four times a (defmacro) with hard-coded directions.
;; The hard-coded parameter must go all the way down
;; to the last instructions needing that direction.
;; So we have (defmacro) calling other (defmacro).

;; What is the purpose `eval-when-compile'?
;; It folds down a numerical expression to just one number
;; for instance
;;   (eval-when-compile (ash 3 (* 2 uniline-direction-lf←)))
;; is converted to just 192
;; This happens both in interpreted and byte-compiled code
;; Otherwise the operations ash, multiplication,
;; and retrieval from `uniline-direction-lf←'
;; would be computed over and over at runtime,
;; with always the same 192 result.
;; We could put directly 192 in the source code,
;; but this would defeat maintenance and readability.

;; What is the purpose `eval-and-compile'?
;; The byte-compiler expands all defmacro' called in defun's.
;; In turn, those defmacro's need to access some defconst's,
;; notably `uniline-direction-up↑' and sisters.
;; So those defconst's are made available to the byte-compiler
;; as well as to the runtime, by embedding them in a
;; `eval-and-compile' declaration.

;; When a decision makes the byte-compiled code better
;; (faster to load and run), at the expense of a slower
;; interpreted counterpart, then go ahead, bias toward
;; byte-compiled code.

;;;│Perfect hash tables│
;;;╰───────────────────╯

;; When an hash-table is constant, with entries known at compile-time,
;; then a perfect hash-table can be built. Perfect means that there
;; are no collisions: each bucket contains one entry, or none, never
;; two entries. This makes the hash-table very efficient.
;; The usual multiple entries scanning can be entirely bypassed.
;;
;; Uniline has 13 constant hash-tables. We want to make them
;; perfect, collision-less. 3 Options:
;;
;; 1- Define a custom hash-function like
;;    (% key 191)
;;    by looking for the right constant like 191, we can get a
;;    collision-less hash-table
;;    as shown by (internal--hash-table-histogram)
;;  - Unfortunately, this makes the resulting hash-table roughly
;;    3 times slower than a regular (make-hash-table), even one
;;    with collisions.
;;
;; 2- Use a custom vector instead of a hash-table, along with a
;;    hashing function like
;;    (% key (length custom-vector))
;;    This amounts to re-creating hash-tables with vectors.
;;  - The result is slightly slower than (make-hash-table), even
;;    with collisions, about 30% slower.
;;
;; 3- Use a standard hash-table and tweak its size
;;    (make-hash-table :size 114)
;;  - Unfortunately, the specified size is not retained in the
;;    compiled *.elc file
;;    Beside, the specified size gets rounded to the next power of 2
;;
;; 4- Create the constant hash-table with
;;    (make-hash-table :size 114)
;;    when loading the compiled *.elc file
;;    Store in the *.elc a list of pairs (key . value)
;;  - This bypasses the #s(hash-table …) form that was handy in the
;;    *.elc, but at no cost in the *.elc size and almost nothing
;;    for the hash-table creation process at load-time
;;
;; This 4th solution is implemented hereafter through a macro
;; which bundles:
;;   - (defconst …)
;;   - (make-hash-table :size my-preferred-size)
;;   - populating the hash-table from a list of pairs loaded from *.elc

;;;╭─────────────╮
;;;│Mouse support│
;;;╰─────────────╯

;; How it works?
;; The 3 mouse-button-1 handling functions of Emacs are
;; fairly complex. They are named:
;;   mouse-set-point, mouse-drag-region, mouse-set-region.
;;
;; Here we just let them do whatever they want to. But first
;; we intercept them, so that Uniline can add blank
;; characters or lines if the mouse event falls outside the
;; buffer.
;;
;; The mouse events provide a (point) position, which is
;; wrong when outside the buffer. But they also provide a
;; position in pixels along with the width and height in
;; pixels of a typical character. This allows to reconstruct
;; a hopefully accurate (point) position, which we re-inject
;; in the mouse event in place of the wrong (point) position.
;;
;; Of course, things are tricky because the pixel-position is
;; relative to the upper-left corner of the displayed window,
;; while we need the buffer-position. We use the (window-start)
;; function to get the line number under the upper-left corner.
;; And the (scroll-left 0) function to get the column number
;; of this corner.
;;
;; But thinks get even trickier when the window is zoomed with
;; C-x C-+ C-- and it is scrolled with C-x <. In this case,
;; the result of (scroll-left 0) is wrong. It does not
;; account for the zoom. So we have to reconstruct the actual
;; value using the text-scale-mode-amount variable, which
;; contains the number of x1.2 zooms (1.2 is stored in the
;; text-scale-mode-step variable).
;;
;; But reconstruction trying to reverse a computation which
;; mixes floating point numbers along with rounding to
;; integers is impossible to do accurately. Therefore, the
;; mouse placement when the window is zoomed AND scrolled
;; horizontally is not perfect.
;;
;; Moreover, each click generates 1, 2, or 3 events. The
;; first one is used by Uniline to add blank characters if
;; needed, and adjust the point. The following events also
;; need their point being adjusted as well. But the following
;; events do not have the information that blanks have been
;; added. We do not want to adjust the point if the buffer
;; have not received additional blanks, because in this case
;; the point store in the event is right and accurate. We do
;; not want to ruin it with an unreliable approximation.
;; Therefore we put in place a variable used by the 1st event
;; to communicate information the the 2nd and 3th events.
;;
;; The Uniline intercepting functions are attached to the
;; uniline-mode keymap. Therefore they are active only in
;; uniline-mode.
;;
;; Nothing happens in a non-graphical environment, although
;; the interceptions and keymap-bindings are still present.
;;
;; Picture-mode & Artist-mode also handle the mouse. The
;; picture-mode way, unfortunately, breaks down when the
;; buffer is zoomed (C-x C-+).
;;
;; The artist-mode way smoothly handles zooming. But it is
;; completely off when window is zoomed and horizontally
;; scrolled. Artist-mode re-implements parts of the standard
;; Emacs event handling. This is because it needs to draw
;; while moving the mouse in many different styles. The
;; uniline-mode does not need this complexity.

Those diagrams are pure text. There is nothing graphic. They are
achieved using UNICODE characters. Most often, the text file will be
encoded as UTF-8.

Creating such diagrams by hand is painfully slow. Use Uniline to
draw lines while you move the cursor with keyboard arrows.

*Beware!*

If you see those diagrams miss-aligned, most likely the font used to
display them does not support UNICODE block characters. See bellow the
paragraph "Which fonts?".

* Minor mode
Uniline is a minor mode. Activate it temporarily:

 =M-x uniline-mode=

Exit it with:

 =C-c C-c=

The current major mode is still active underneath =uniline-mode=.

While in =uniline-mode=, overwritting is active, as well as long lines
truncation. Also, a hollow cursor is provided. Those settings are
reset to their previous state when exiting =uniline-mode=.

* Drawing lines
Use keybord arrows to draw lines.

By default, drawing lines only happens over empty space or over other
lines. If there is already text, it will not be erased. However, by
hiting the control-key while moving, lines overwrite whatever there
is.

The buffer is "infinite" in bottom and right directions. Which means
that when the cursor ends up outside the buffer, white space
characters are automatically added.

The usual numeric prefix is available. For instance, to draw a line 12
characters wide downward, type: =M-12 <down>=

* Brush style
Set the current brush with:

- = - = single thin line
  =╭─┬─╮=

- = + = single thick line
  =┏━┳━┓=

- = = = double line
  =╔═╦═╗=

- = # = quarter block
  =▙▄▟▀=

- =<delete>= eraser

- =<return>= move without drawing anything

* The =<insert>= key
The =<insert>= key is a prefix for other keys:
- for drawing arrows, squares, crosses, o-shapes glyphs,
- for handling rectangles,
- for inserting =# = - += which otherwise change the brush style,
- for trying a choice of monospaced fonts.

Why =<insert>=? Because:
- Uniline tries to leave their original meaning to as much keys as possible,
- the standard meaning of =<insert>= is to toggle the overwrite mode;
  but Uniline is already in overwrite mode, and de-activating
  overwrite would break Uniline.

So preempting =<insert>= does not sacrifices anything.

* Arrows glyphs =▷ ▶ → ▹ ▸=
At any time, an arrow may be drawn. The arrow points in the direction
that the line drawing follows.

Uniline supports 5 arrows types: =▷ ▶ → ▹ ▸=

[[file:images/arrow-styles.png]]

#+begin_example

    △    ▵    ↑    ▲    ▴
   ◁ ▷  ◃ ▹  ← →  ◀ ▶  ◂ ▸
    ▽    ▿    ↓    ▼    ▾

#+end_example

Actually, there are tons of arrows of all styles in the UNICODE
standard. Unfortunately, the support by fonts is weak. So Uniline
restrains itself to those five safe arrows.

To insert an arrow, type: =<insert>a= or =<insert>aa= or =<insert>aaa=. (=a=
cycles through the 5 styles, =A= cycles backward).

=<insert>3a= is equivalent to =<insert>aaa=, which is also equivalent to
=<insert>A=. Those 3 shortcuts insert an arrow of this style: =→↑←↓=. The
actual direction where the arrow points follows the last movement of
the cursor.

To change the direction of the arrow, use shift-arrow, for example:
=S-<up>= will change it from =→= to =↑=.

* Intersection glyphs =■ ◆ ●=
There are a few other UNICODE characters which are monospace and
symetric in the 4 directions. They are great at line intersections:

To insert a square =□ ■ ▫ ▪ ◇ ◆ ◊= type:
=<insert>sss...= (=s= cycles, =S= cycles backward).

To insert a circular shape =· ∙ • ● ◦ Ø ø= type:
=<insert>ooo...= (=o= cycles, =O= cycles backward).

To insert a cross shape =╳ ÷ × ± ¤= type:
=<insert>xxx...= (=x= cycles, =X= cycles backward).

To insert a usual ASCII letter or symbol, just type it.

As the keys =- + = #= are preempted by Uniline mode, to type them,
prefix them with =<insert>=. Example: =<insert>-= inserts a =-= and
=<insert>+= inserts a =+=.

* Drawing rectangles
To draw a rectangle in one shot, select a rectangular region with
=C-SPC= or =C-x SPC= and move the cursor.

If needed, change the brush with any of
 =- + = # <delete>=

then hit
- =    r= to draw a rectangle inside the selection
- =  S-R= to draw a rectangle ouside the selection
- =  C-r= to overwrite a rectangle inside the selection
- =C-S-R= to overwrite a rectangle ouside the selection

The usual =C-_= or =C-/= keys may be hit to undo, even with the region still
active visually.

* Moving rectangles
Select a region, then press =<insert>=. The selection becomes rectangular if it
was not.

Use arrow keys to move the rectangle around. A numeric prefix may be
used to move the rectangle that many characters. Be sure to specify
the numeric prefix with just digits, without the =Alt= key. Typing
=15<left>= moves the rectangle 15 characters to the left. =M-15<left>=
does not work.

Press =q=, =RET=, or =C-g= to stop moving the rectangle.

The =C-_= key may also be used to undo the previous movements, even
though the selection is still active.

#+end_example

A rectangle can be copied or killed, then yanked somewhere else. Press:
- =c= to copy
- =k= to kill
- =y= to yank (aka paste)

This is similar to the Emacs standard rectangle handling:
- =C-x r r= copy rectangle to register
- =C-x r k= kill rectangle
- =C-x r y= yank killed rectangle

The difference is that Uniline rectangles when killed and yanked, do not
move surrounding characters.

Uniline and Emacs standard rectangle share the same storage for copied
and killed rectangles, =killed-rectangle=. So, a rectangle can be killed
one way, and yanked another way.

* Which fonts?
A monospace character font must be used. It must also support UNICODE.

Not all fonts are born equal.

- =(set-frame-font "DejaVu Sans Mono")=
- =(set-frame-font "Unifont"         )=
- =(set-frame-font "Hack"            )=
- =(set-frame-font "JetBrains Mono"  )=
- =(set-frame-font "Cascadia Mono"   )=
- =(set-frame-font "Agave"           )=
- =(set-frame-font "JuliaMono"       )=
- =(set-frame-font "FreeMono"        )=

Those fonts are known to support the required UNICODE characters, AND
display them as monospace. There are fonts advertized as monospace
which give arbitrary widths to non-ASCII characters. That is bad for
the kind of drawings done by Uniline.

You may want to try any of the 8 suggested fonts. Just hit the
corresponding entry in the Uniline menu, or type =<insert>f=. You may
also execute the above Lisp commands like that:

=M-: (set-frame-font "DejaVu Sans Mono")=

This setting is for the current session only. If you want to make it
permanent, you may use the Emacs customization:

=INS f *=

or

=M-x customize-face default=

Beware that Emacs tries to compensate for missing UNICODE support by
the current font. Emacs substitutes one font for another, character
per character. The user may not notice until the dawings done under
Emacs are displayed on another text editor or on the Web.

To know which font Emacs has choosen for a given character, type:

=C-u C-x ==

* Line spacing
The =line-spacing= setting in Emacs can change the display of a sketch.

The best looking effect is given by:
: (setq line-spacing nil)

You may want to change your current setting. Uniline may handle this
variable some day. Right now, =line-spacing= is left as a matter of
choice for everyone.

* Exotic environments
** Emacs on the Linux console
Linux consoles are the 7 non-graphic screens which can be accessed
usually typing =C-M-F1=, =C-M-F2=, and so on. Such a screen is also
presented when connecting through ssh into a non-graphical server.

By default they use a font
named "Fixed" with poor support for Unicode. However, it supports
lines of the 3 types, mixing all of them in thin lines though.

Another problem is that by default =S-<left>= and =C-<left>= are
indistinguishable from =<left>=. Same problem with =<right>=, =<up>=, =<down>=
and =<insert>=. This has nothing to do with Emacs. A solution can be
found here: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MissingKeys

** Emacs on a graphical terminal emulator
This is the Emacs launched from a terminal typing =emacs -nw=. In this
environment, =<insert>= does not exists. It is replaced by
=<insertchar>=. This has already been taken into account by Uniline by
duplicating the key-bindings for the two flavors of this key.

If you decide to bind globally =C-<insert>= to the toggling of Uniline
minor mode as suggested, then you will have to do the same for
=C-<insertchar>=, for example with =use-package= in your =~/.emacs= file:

#+begin_example
(use-package uniline
  :defer t
  :bind ("C-<insert>"     . uniline-mode)
  :bind ("C-<insertchar>" . uniline-mode))
#+end_example

** Emacs on Windows
On Windows the only native monospaced fonts are Lucida Console and
Courier New. They are not monospaced for the Unicodes used by uniline.

Often, the Cosolas font is present on Windows. It supports quite well
the required Unicodes to draw lines. A few glyphs produce unaligned
result though. They should be avoided under Consolas: =△▶▹◇◆=

Of course, other fonts may be installed. It is quite easy.

* Installation

Add the following lines to your =.emacs= file,
and reload it, if not already done:

#+begin_example
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+end_example

Alternately you may customize this variable:

#+begin_example
M-x customize-variable package-archives
#+end_example

Then download the package:

#+begin_example
(package-install "uniline")
#+end_example

Alternately, you can download the Lisp file, and load it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(load-file "uniline.el")
#+END_EXAMPLE

You may want to give =uniline-mode= a key-binding. =use-package=
in your =$HOME/.emacs= file is great for that:

#+begin_example
(use-package uniline
  :defer t
  :bind ("C-<insert>" . uniline-mode))
#+end_example

In this example, =C-<insert>= was choosen. You can use whatever keys combination you want.
=<insert>= happens to also be the key used inside Uniline.

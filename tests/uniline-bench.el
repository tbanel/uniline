;;; Commentary:

;; Running regression tests
;; Just load this file:
;;   (load "uniline-bench.el")
;; or
;;   (eval-buffer)
;;
;; If OK, a message is displayed
;; If ERROR, two windows are displayed, the actual and the expected sketchs
;; with points on the first difference.

;; Creating a new bench
;; - Eval (uniline-bench-create)
;; - Draw a sketch
;; - When done, type $
;; A Lisp buffer implementing the new test is displayed
;; - Save it permanently in a file ending in *.el along with this one
